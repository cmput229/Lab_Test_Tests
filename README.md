# Lab $X tests repository
This repository simply contains all the test cases for lab $X. `.in` files are the input for the program while `.out` is the correct output when run.

## How to contribute
To add a test case, create a pull request with a two new files: `X.in` and `X.out`, where X is your GitHub username plus a number starting from 1 to however many test cases you decide to add. This is to avoid any conflict in naming files. For example, if this is your first test case and your username is **torvalds**, create two files called `torvalds1.in` and `torvalds1.out`. The next time you add another test case, it would be called `torvalds2.in` and `torvalds2.out`.
